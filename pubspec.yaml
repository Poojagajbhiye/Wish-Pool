# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    # - assets/app_icon.png
    # - assets/wp_icon.png
    - assets/splash_screen_icon.png
    - assets/cloud.png
    # - assets/wish_pool.png
    # - assets/wish_pool_200.png
    # - assets/wish_pool_250.png
    # - assets/wish_pool_cloud.png
    # - assets/wish_pool_cloud_new.png
    - assets/empty_wishes.png
    - assets/empty_wishes_black.png
    - assets/empty_wishes_white.png
    # - assets/g-logo.png

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/static/Nunito-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/static/Nunito-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/static/Nunito-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/static/Nunito-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/static/Nunito-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
          style: italic
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
